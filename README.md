# Telecom-Churn-Prediction

In the highly competitive telecom industry, customers can easily switch between service providers, making retention a critical business challenge. Customer expectations are high, often shaped by individual service experiences—and even brief service disruptions can significantly impact satisfaction. Given the high cost of customer acquisition, retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Customer churn refers to subscribers who cancel or fail to renew their services. A high churn rate directly impacts revenue and long-term growth. By analyzing historical customer data and identifying churn drivers, telecom companies can proactively design targeted retention strategies, improve service quality, and enhance overall customer experience.

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn by leveraging both numerical and categorical customer attributes. This is formulated as a binary classification problem on an imbalanced dataset, where the objective is to accurately identify customers who are at high risk of churning, enabling timely and data driven intervention strategies.
