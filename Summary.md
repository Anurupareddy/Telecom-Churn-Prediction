This analysis identifies key churn drivers and high-impact customer segments that directly influence revenue retention and customer lifetime value (CLV). Three customer segments require focused retention strategies: Senior Citizens, customers living with a partner, and customers living alone.

Although Senior Citizens represent a smaller customer base, they exhibit higher baseline Monthly Charges, indicating strong revenue potential when service quality meets expectations. Customers living with partners or alone are more price-sensitive, with higher churn observed once Monthly Charges exceed approximately 65, highlighting the importance of disciplined pricing for these segments.

The first six months of customer tenure emerge as the most critical period for churn prevention. Investment in Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, and Technical Support during this phase significantly improves early retention, strengthening long-term CLV and reducing acquisition cost waste.

High-revenue services such as Fiber Optic Internet and Multiple Lines drive ARPU growth but face adoption challenges due to high entry pricing. Strategic service bundling can increase average revenue per user while minimizing churn by discouraging low-value plan combinations and promoting balanced, value-oriented offerings.

Billing and payment mechanisms also materially affect churn. Electronic Check payments are strongly associated with higher churn and should be deprioritized in favor of automatic bank transfer and credit card payments, which support longer customer retention and more predictable revenue streams.

From a predictive analytics perspective, XGBoost delivered the strongest churn detection performance, maximizing recall of high-risk customers and enabling earlier intervention. This directly supports revenue protection by prioritizing retention actions toward customers most likely to churn.
